Audiences have been enjoying Tony's shows for over 50 years! He's been a
working jazz musician in Cheltenham, Gloucester, and throughout the
Cotswolds all his life. From his early days with the Delta Jazzmen and
the Tony Lowe Four, he's performed thousands of times for perhaps a
hundred thousand people.

Tony conducts the Glevum Big Band, and he conducted the Crescendo Big
Band for many years. He performed as part of the Ain't Misbehavin' duo
for over 20 years and led GYJO, the Gloucestershire Youth Jazz
Orchestra, for almost 25 years.

Nothing elevates an event like live music. You will appreciate
musicians who can blend into the background or take centre stage with
style, depending on the needs of your event. Guests will leave your
event with fond memories.
