Tony is a professional jazz and swing musician providing live music entertainment
throughout Gloucestershire and the Cotswolds.

Tony has many years of performing experience on keyboards, vocals,
and trombone. He works with many other musicians to form ensembles
suitable for any occasion.

### Book Tony With an Ensemble

Book Tony with a Big Band or with a smaller ensemble. A duo can make a
big sound but fit on a small stage.

Need some quiet background music to start and up-tempo dance numbers
for later?  A little Glenn Miller style swing? We do that!

You choose the music from a playlist in a wide variety of styles:
swing and jazz of course but also blues, Latin, and other styles upon
request.

None of these options are too loud. You can hold a conversation during
the show.

Insurance.
