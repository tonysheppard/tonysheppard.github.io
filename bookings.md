### Contact Us for a No-Obligation Quote

Your event is unique. You deserve a jazz and swing group who are
professional at all times.

Email [tony@tonyjazz.com](mailto:tony@tonyjazz.com)<br>
or call 01452 714287.

Our fees are calculated at basic Musicians' Union rates based on the
type of performance, the playing times, and distance travelled. Quotes
are all inclusive with no hidden costs.

Please provide as much information as you can so that we can provide a
realistic quote. It would be especially helpful to know:

* The date of your event.

* The name of the venue and its location (with postcode please!).

* Whether you want a Big Band to fill a larger space, or if the event
  is more intimate for a smaller ensemble or duo.

* When your event starts and finishes and how long you want us to
  play. Our usual quote is for 90 minutes of actual playing time with
  extra time priced in increments of 30 minutes.

* What type of event it is: Private party, wedding reception, birthday
  party, Anniversary celebration, Christmas party, hotel, restaurant,
  barbecue, jazz club, concert, or corporate function. Charity
  fundraisers receive special reduced rates.

* Age range of the audience so we can determine a playlist. You can
  also request _in advance_ a particular song or a particular style.

* Any special requirements. Do you need recorded music to cover
  breaks? We usually arrive one hour before the start of our first
  performance but we can set up earlier for an extra charge.
